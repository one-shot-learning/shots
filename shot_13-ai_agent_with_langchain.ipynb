      "\n",
      "Members of the group, known as the Rose City Nationalists, had their masks removed during a scuffle at an LGBTQ pride event in Oregon. When footage from the event appeared online, some X users incorrectly identified one of men involved in the incident as Benjamin Brody, a 22-year-old who belonged to a Jewish fraternity and previously remarked on the fraternity‚Äôs website that he wanted a job with the government.\n",

      "Musk amplified the false claims on X at the time, describing the incident ‚Äî and Brody‚Äôs purported involvement ‚Äî as a ‚Äúprobably false flag situation.‚Äù When Musk waded into the false conspiracy theory, his massive presence on the platform resulted in a deluge of hate toward Brody. According to the lawsuit, Brody and his family were ‚Äúrepeatedly doxed and suffered an enormous wave of harassment from belligerent strangers.‚Äù\n",

      "‚ÄúTwo weeks after Musk‚Äôs statements, it was apparent to Ben that his reputation had been catastrophically damaged and that a huge number of people believed he was either a neo-Nazi or a provocateur involved in a deceptive ‚Äòpsyop‚Äô to commit political terrorism,‚Äù the lawsuit reads.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn‚Äôt the first time Musk has been sued for defamation over careless and inflammatory remarks. British cave diver Vernon Unsworth sued Musk for calling him a ‚Äúpedo guy‚Äù during a heated back-and-forth centered on the 2018 rescue operation to save kids trapped in a cave in Thailand. Musk ultimately triumphed in court in 2019.\n",

      "\n",
      "U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam‚Äôs ruling isn‚Äôt a win for the defensibility of Tesla‚Äôs advanced driver assistance systems, Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD), but simply for Tesla‚Äôs terms and conditions. The plaintiffs who filed the proposed class action in September 2022 did in fact agree to arbitrate any legal claims against the company when they signed on the dotted line, according to the judge. They had 30 days to opt out, and none chose to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forced arbitration has been a stalwart partner in the tech industry. Tesla‚Äôs success in dodging a class action lawsuit could encourage other automakers to lean more heavily on this tactic.\n",
      "\n",
      "‚ÄúIn some respects, it probably does put down a marker that these types of claims will likely face these types of challenges,‚Äù Ryan Koppelman, partner at law firm Alston & Bird, told TechCrunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Koppelman noted that arbitration is a common legal strategy used by companies to avoid individual claims and class actions like this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this specific case, a fifth plaintiff did opt out of arbitration, but Judge Gilliam ruled to¬†dismiss their claims, as they waited too long to sue, according to court documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "‚ÄúThe statue of limitation aspect is interesting because the claims at issue here had to do with what the Tesla products will be capable of in the future, as well as what they were supposedly capable of at the time of sale,‚Äù said Koppelman.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plaintiffs in the case all claimed to have spent thousands of dollars on unreliable and dangerous technology that has caused accidents, some resulting in death. Tesla has denied wrongdoing and moved to send the claims to arbitration, after citing the plaintiffs‚Äô acceptance of the arbitration agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge Gilliam also denied the plaintiffs‚Äô motion for preliminary injunction ‚Äúprohibiting the defendant from continuing to engage in its allegedly illegal and deceptive practices.‚Äù In effect, the plaintiffs asked the court to force Tesla to stop marketing their ADAS as providing ‚Äúfull self-driving capability‚Äù; to stop selling and de-activate their FSD beta software; and to alert all customers that Tesla‚Äôs use of terms like ‚Äúfull self-driving capability,‚Äù ‚Äúself-driving‚Äù and ‚Äúautonomous‚Äù to describe the ADAS technology was inaccurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original complaint, filed in September 2022, alleged that Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk have been deceitfully advertising its automated driving features as either fully functioning or close to being ‚Äúsolved‚Äù since 2016, despite knowing full well that the capabilities of Autopilot and FSD don‚Äôt live up to the hype.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plaintiffs alleged that Tesla‚Äôs ADAS cause vehicles to run red lights, miss turns and veer into traffic, all the while costing Tesla owners thousands of dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Briggs Matsko, the named plaintiff in the lawsuit, said he paid $5,000 for his 2018 Tesla Model X to get Enhanced Autopilot. Tesla‚Äôs FSD costs an additional $12,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "The failed class action isn‚Äôt the only time Tesla‚Äôs so-called self-driving technology has come under scrutiny. Earlier this year, Musk was found to have overseen a 2016 video that overstated the capabilities of Autopilot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The revelation came from¬†a deposition from a senior engineer taken as evidence in¬†a lawsuit against Tesla for a fatal 2018 crash¬†involving former Apple engineer Walter Huang.
